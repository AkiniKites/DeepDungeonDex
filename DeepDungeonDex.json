  "Description": "A live bestiary for Deep Dungeon. Shows target mob aggro type, a subjective threat level, vulnerability to stun, and a general overview of notable mechanics. Threat level is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, is aimed towards solo players, and assumes a general familiarity with\ndeep dungeon mechanics and the class being played. Information is accurate to the best of my knowledge based on crowdsourced information, but please open an issue on the GitHub or ping me in either the Deep Dungeons or QuickLauncher Discord servers if anything is found to be inaccurate or if you'd like to make a report on untested data.",
